# Analysis
##The Script
The entire analysis is performed by the "run_analysis.R" script.  It generates two
data objects, both data frames, called "firstTidyDataset" and "secondTidyDataset".

All that is required for the analysis is to run "run_analysis.R" with replacement
of the "XXXX Your working directory here XXXX" tag with your local working directory.
